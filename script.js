// Data Structures Exercise

/*
1a. Create a const variable named jedi and set the value of the variable to an empty array
1b. Using index add "Luke" to the jedi array (Should be the first and only item in the array)
1c. Using the Push method add "Obi-Wan Kenobi" to the jedi array
1d. Using the Unshift method add "Yoda" the jedi array
1e. Using index on the jedi array display "Luke" (You will need a console log for this)
1f. Using another array method remove "Obi-Wan Kenobi" from the end of the jedi array
1g. Finally, using another method remove "Yoda" from the beginning of the jedi array and display the final value of 
    the array (HINT: It should just be "Luke". Also, you will need a console log for this.)
2a. Create a const variable named sithLords and set the value of the variable to the following array items "Darth 
    Vader", "Darth Sidious", and "Darth Maul"
2b. Create another const variable named imperialOfficers and set the value of the variable to the following array 
    items "Grand Moff Tarkin" and "Orson Krennic".
2c. Using the concat method join the two arrays into one and set the value to a new const variable called 
    starWarsVillains. Also, display the value of the new starWarsVillains variable (Also, make sure the sithLords 
    are first in the new array. Also, you will need a console log for this.)
2d. Using the slice method on the starWarsVillains array display an array that contains "Darth Vader" and "Darth 
    Sidious" in the terminal/console (You will need a console log for this)
3a. Create a const variable called droids and set the value to an object with the following key value pairs 
    (astromech: "R2-D2"), (protocol: "C-3PO"), and (assassin: "IG-88")
3b. Display "R2-D2" from the droids variable/object in terminal/console using square brackets "[]" (You will need 
    a console log for this)
3c. Display "C-3PO" from the droids variable/object in terminal/console using dot "." (You will need a console log 
    for this)
3d. In the droids variable/object change the "IG-88" value to "IG-11"
